/**
 * @file fault.c
 *
 * This file implements the screen that may be viewed when the game crashes.
 * This is the second version of the crash screen, originally used in Majora's Mask.
 *
 * When the game crashes, a red bar will be drawn to the top-left of the screen, indicating that the
 * crash screen is available for use. Once this bar appears, it is possible to open the crash screen
 * with the following button combination:
 *
 * (L & R & Z) + DPad-Up + C-Down + C-Up + DPad-Down + DPad-Left + C-Left + C-Right + DPad-Right + (B & A & START)
 *
 * When entering this button combination, buttons that are &'d together must all be pressed together.
 * The L & R presses and B & A presses may be interchanged in the order they are pressed.
 *
 * "Clients" may be registered with the crash screen to extend its functionality. There are
 * two kinds of client, "Client" and "AddressConverterClient". Clients contribute one or
 * more pages to the crash debugger, while Address Converter Clients allow the crash screen to look up
 * the virtual addresses of dynamically allocated overlays.
 *
 * The crash screen has multiple pages:
 *  - Thread Context
 *      This page shows information about the thread on which the program crashed. It displays
 *      the cause of the crash, state of general-purpose registers, state of floating-point registers
 *      and the floating-point status register. If a floating-point exception caused the crash, it will
 *      be displayed next to the floating-point status register.
 *  - Stack Trace
 *      This page displays a full backtrace from the crashing function back to the start of the thread. It
 *      displays the Program Counter for each function and, if applicable, the Virtual Program Counter
 *      for relocated functions in overlays.
 *  - Client Pages
 *      After the stack trace page, currently registered clients are processed and their pages are displayed.
 *  - Memory Dump
 *      This page implements a scrollable memory dump.
 *  - End Screen
 *      This page informs you that there are no more pages to display.
 *
 * To navigate the pages, START and A may be used to advance to the next page, and L toggles whether to
 * automatically scroll to the next page after some time has passed.
 * DPad-Up may be pressed to enable sending fault pages over osSyncPrintf as well as displaying them on-screen.
 * DPad-Down disables sending fault pages over osSyncPrintf.

 * Searches a single function's stack frame for the function it was called from.
 * There are two cases that must be covered: Leaf and non-leaf functions.
 *
 * A leaf function is one that does not call any other function, in this case the
 * return address need not be saved to the stack. Since a leaf function does not
 * call other functions, only the function the stack trace begins in could possibly
 * be a leaf function, in which case the return address is in the thread context's
 * $ra already, as it never left.
 *
 * The procedure is therefore
 *  - Iterate instructions
 *  - Once jr $ra is found, set pc to $ra
 *  - Done after delay slot
 *
 * A non-leaf function calls other functions, it is necessary for the return address
 * to be saved to the stack. In these functions, it is important to keep track of the
 * stack frame size of each function.
 *
 * The procedure is therefore
 *  - Iterate instructions
 *  - If lw $ra <imm>($sp) is found, fetch the saved $ra from stack memory
 *  - If addiu $sp, $sp, <imm> is found, modify $sp by the immediate value
 *  - If jr $ra is found, set pc to $ra
 *  - Done after delay slot
 *
 * Note that searching for one jr $ra is sufficient, as only leaf functions can have
 * multiple jr $ra in the same function.
 *
 * There is also additional handling for eret and j. Neither of these instructions
 * appear in IDO compiled C, however do show up in the exception handler. It is not
 * possible to backtrace through an eret as an interrupt can occur at any time, so
 * there is no choice but to give up here. For j instructions, they can be followed
 * and the backtrace may continue as normal.
