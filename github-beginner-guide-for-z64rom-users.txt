  
  github beginner guide for z64rom users
  
  there will be a video version of this later, or at least a guide
  that includes pictures; check the official z64rom repo for updates
  
  in case things have changed, refer to the latest version of this guide here:
   - https://github.com/z64utils/z64rom/blob/main/project/github-beginner-guide-for-z64rom-users.txt
  
  and the latest version of the accompanying .gitignore can be found here:
   - https://github.com/z64utils/z64rom/blob/main/project/.gitignore
  
  before you proceed, please set up a github account
  
  it is also recommended that windows users install notepad++ for viewing
  and editing this guide and the files it mentions
  
  first, set up your project on github by following these steps:
    1  install github desktop
    2  click file -> new repository
    3  create a repository somewhere easily accessible
       (important: not inside the folder for your project)
    4  click repository -> show in your file manager (or explorer)
    5  it will open the folder of your repository
    6  copy the .gitignore file from the latest z64rom release into that folder
       (and make sure it is named .gitignore; if you cannot find it, turn on
        hidden file visibility on your computer; also enable file extensions)
       (note: if you renamed the .vanilla folders in your project to something
        other than .vanilla, you must open your .gitignore file in notepad++
        and replace all occurrences of .vanilla with _vanilla or whatever you
        renamed .vanilla to)
    7  place the entire contents of your z64rom project in there too
       (such that project.toml is in the root folder, not in a subdirectory)
    8  go back to github desktop and you will see a list of files added on
       the 'changes' tab; those are your project files
    9  also on the 'changes' tab, there is a 'summary' field; this is where
       you write your commit message: "wow my project is now on github!"
   10  you can optionally write a description if you want to include more info
   11  then click 'commit to main'
   12  follow steps 8 - 11 any time you reach any project milestone: whether
       it's a small tweak to npc text, or you've made progress on a 3d model
       (it's important to commit regularly, as well as before any major change,
        so that you will always be able to roll back if anything breaks)
   13  after your first commit, you can click 'publish repository'
       (don't worry, it won't be public unless you mark it public)
   14  if you have already published your repository, the same button will
       read 'push origin'; this is how you back up your work to github, and
       also how other collaborators can see it
  
  then, invite your teammates to your repo, and have them follow these steps:
    1  install github desktop
    2  clone your repo using github desktop
    3  download z64rom.zip
    4  extract z64rom.zip into their copy of the repo
    5  run z64rom.exe
    6  follow the steps to install the tools
  
  this is not a completely exhaustive guide, so please learn by experimenting!
  start by creating a new branch, doing some things on it, and then merging
  it into main; this is how you will generally work on a team, with everyone
  working on their own branch, or on specific branches for specific features
  
  it may be intimidating at first, so consider watching some videos or reading
  some tutorials
  
  using github for your project will help you recover your work if anything
  ever goes wrong, and will also make it easier to update to future versions
  of z64rom releases in the future
  
  that should cover everything, now go have fun and make lots of cool projects!
